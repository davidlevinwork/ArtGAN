# ArtGAN: Art Style Transfer with Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks

In this paper, I present ArtGAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that leverages self-attention mechanisms for efficient art style transfer. By incorporating the attention mechanism in the generator network, our method enables the model to focus on relevant features in the input image and generate high-quality stylized output. I demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using two prominent artists, Vincent van Gogh, and Pablo Picasso, and evaluate the model performance on their respective datasets. Experimental results show that ArtGAN outperforms the CycleGAN model without attention in terms of visual quality and style transfer fidelity, illustrating the effectiveness of incorporating attention mechanisms in the style transfer process.
